# Twitch-Chat-Tracker
This Python-based bot automatically detects the latest Twitch streams and scans their chat for specific keywords. Once a keyword is detected, the bot logs the message and the stream link. The bot is customizable to detect any keywords defined by the user and can run continuously to monitor multiple streams simultaneously.
